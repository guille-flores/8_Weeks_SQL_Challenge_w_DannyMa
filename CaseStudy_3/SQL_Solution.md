### A. Customer Journey
Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

```sql
SELECT
	customer_id,
    s.plan_id,
    p.plan_name,
    start_date
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
INNER JOIN foodie_fi.plans p ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id
WHERE customer_id IN ('1', '2', '11', '13', '15', '16', '18', '19')
ORDER BY customer_id, start_date
```

| customer_id | plan_id | plan_name     | start_date               |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1           | 0       | trial         | 2020-08-01T00:00:00.000Z |
| 1           | 1       | basic monthly | 2020-08-08T00:00:00.000Z |
| 2           | 0       | trial         | 2020-09-20T00:00:00.000Z |
| 2           | 3       | pro annual    | 2020-09-27T00:00:00.000Z |
| 11          | 0       | trial         | 2020-11-19T00:00:00.000Z |
| 11          | 4       | churn         | 2020-11-26T00:00:00.000Z |
| 13          | 0       | trial         | 2020-12-15T00:00:00.000Z |
| 13          | 1       | basic monthly | 2020-12-22T00:00:00.000Z |
| 13          | 2       | pro monthly   | 2021-03-29T00:00:00.000Z |
| 15          | 0       | trial         | 2020-03-17T00:00:00.000Z |
| 15          | 2       | pro monthly   | 2020-03-24T00:00:00.000Z |
| 15          | 4       | churn         | 2020-04-29T00:00:00.000Z |
| 16          | 0       | trial         | 2020-05-31T00:00:00.000Z |
| 16          | 1       | basic monthly | 2020-06-07T00:00:00.000Z |
| 16          | 3       | pro annual    | 2020-10-21T00:00:00.000Z |
| 18          | 0       | trial         | 2020-07-06T00:00:00.000Z |
| 18          | 2       | pro monthly   | 2020-07-13T00:00:00.000Z |
| 19          | 0       | trial         | 2020-06-22T00:00:00.000Z |
| 19          | 2       | pro monthly   | 2020-06-29T00:00:00.000Z |
| 19          | 3       | pro annual    | 2020-08-29T00:00:00.000Z |


We can see that 
- customer 1 started with a trial plan and, which last 7 days. Right after the trial ended, the consumer upgraded to a basic monthly plan.
- customer 2, on the other hand, started with a trial and upgraded to a pro annual plan right after the trial period.
- customer 11 started the trial and cancelled the subscription after the trial ended
- customer 13 stated as customer 1, from trial to basic monthly plans. Then, after 7 days on basic plan, the customer upgraded to a pro monthly plan.
- customer 15 went from trial to pro monthly, and after a bit more than 1 month, the customer cancelled the subscription.
- customer 16 went from trial to basic monthly, and then, after 4.5 months happened, changed to pro annual.
- customer 18 went from trial to pro monthly as soon as the trial ended
- Finally, customer 19 went form trial to pro monthly, and after 2 months changed it to pro annual.

### B. Data Analysis Questions
1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had? 

```sql
SELECT
	COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
```

| count |
| ----- |
| 1000  |

2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value

```sql
SELECT
    TO_CHAR(
      MAKE_DATE(
        DATE_PART('year', start_date)::INTEGER, 
        DATE_PART('month', start_date)::INTEGER, 
        1),
      'yyyy-mm-dd') AS date_yyyy_mm_dd,
      COUNT(*) AS number_of_trial_customers
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
INNER JOIN foodie_fi.plans p
	ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id
WHERE s.plan_id = '0'
GROUP BY DATE_PART('year', start_date), DATE_PART('month', start_date)
ORDER BY date_yyyy_mm_dd
```


| date_yyyy_mm_dd | number_of_trial_customers |

            COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
         FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
        ) AS total_customers
    FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
    WHERE plan_id = '0'
)

SELECT
	plan_name,
    COUNT(*) AS number_of_customers,
    TO_CHAR(100*COUNT(*)::FLOAT/total_customers::FLOAT, 'fm00D00%') AS percentage
FROM (
  SELECT 
      s.customer_id,
      s.plan_id,
  	  plan_name,
      start_date,
      trial_date,
	  total_customers,
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.customer_id, s.plan_id) AS row_num
  FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
  INNER JOIN trial_cust tr
  		ON tr.customer_id = s.customer_id
  INNER JOIN foodie_fi.plans pl
  		ON s.plan_id =  pl.plan_id
) t1
WHERE row_num = 2
GROUP BY plan_name, total_customers
``` 


| plan_name     | number_of_customers | percentage |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ---------- |
| basic monthly | 546                 | 54.60%     |

```sql
WITH upd_cust_2020 AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        MAX(plan_id) AS plan_id,
        MAX(start_date) AS start_date,
  		(SELECT
         	COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
         FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
         ) AS total_cust
    FROM (
        SELECT

8. How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?

```sql
SELECT
	COUNT(*)
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
WHERE plan_id = '3' AND DATE_PART('year', start_date) = 2020
``` 
| count |
| ----- |
| 195   |

9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?

```sql
WITH customer_join_date AS (
	SELECT
  		customer_id,
  		MIN(start_date) AS joined
 	FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
  	GROUP BY customer_id
), pro_annual_cust AS (
	SELECT
  		customer_id,
  		start_date
 	FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
  	WHERE plan_id = '3'
)

SELECT 
	ROUND(AVG(pro_a.start_date - joined)) AS avg_days_upgrade_proannual
FROM pro_annual_cust pro_a
INNER JOIN customer_join_date AS cjd
	ON cjd.customer_id = pro_a.customer_id

``` 

| avg_days_upgrade_proannual |
| -------------------------- |
| 105                        |

10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)

```sql

``` 
11. How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?



### C. Challenge Payment Question
The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:
* monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
* upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
* upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
* once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

Example outputs for this table might look like the following:
|customer_id	|plan_id	|plan_name	|	payment_date	|amount	|payment_order	|
|---	|---	|---	|	---	|---	|---	|
|1	|1	|basic monthly	|	2020-08-08	|9.9	|1	|
|1	|1	|basic monthly	|	2020-09-08	|9.9	|2	|

|13	|1	|basic monthly	|	2020-12-22	|9.9	|1	|

### D. Outside The Box Questions
The following are open ended questions which might be asked during a technical interview for this case study - there are no right or wrong answers, but answers that make sense from both a technical and a business perspective make an amazing impression!
